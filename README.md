# Mark-at!

For 2021 Celo-mobile-hackathon
[Make it Mobile Hackathon - Celo](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/mobile-celo/onboard)

## 🔎 About Our Project

Our project can increase consumers' access to the flea market and even attract tourists. It's about incorporating cello ecosystems into flea market payments. With our mobile web browser(dApp), at any flea market in any country in the world, payments can be made easier without having to have local currency. The system mechanism provides automatic inter-currency exchange function, which makes the existing exchange process unnecessary and has a lower cost in terms of fees. In addition, the influx of tourists is expected to boost the local economy. 

In addition to attracting tourists, it will also attract the attention of local residents. People become dull no matter how interesting or great they are. The synergy effect of local residents and tourists on the revival of the market will be more than imagined, as our distinctive dApp, which is linked to the local flea market, will attract local residents' attention and make them visit the flea market once more by featuring attractive NFT footprints. We decided on a service concept with animal footprint NFT, adding the characteristics of walking around the market to the meaning of a stamp. We added novelty by setting it as the footprints of thousands of animals on Earth, not ordinary footprints and named the Footprint NFT.

## 📱 dApp Introduction

Our dApp is divided into three parts.

**1) Market Pages**

Users can see the flea market lists shown on the map and check the detailed market informations entered inside the flea market.

**2) NFT Pages**

After payment is completed at the market, Footprint NFT is automatically paid randomly. The paid Footprint NFT are kept on the user's **‘My NFT’** page. Within the ‘**MY NFT’** page, **'My Paint'** function allows you to create a new work with Footprint NFT that you have obtained through payment.

Sellers can register their market regardless of their location or states. They can upload their representative market picture(logo), market products and simple explanations, anyone can administer their market as a seller.
